          <h2 class="chapter-title">MÓDULO HTML/CSS</h2>

          <p><span class="drop-cap">H</span> ypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup <br>
          language for creating web pages and web applications. With <br>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript it forms a triad of <br>
          cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. <br></p>
          <p class="texto-com-identacao"> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With <br>
          HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, <br>
          may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create <br> 
          structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <br>
          headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other itens. HTML <br>
          elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such <br> 
          as <span class = "texto-personalizado">&lt;img /&gt;</span> and <span class="texto-personalizado"> &lt;imput /&gt;</span> 
          introduce content into the page directly. Others <br>
          such as <span class="texto-personalizado"> &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt; </span> surround and provide information about document <br>
          text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not <br>
          display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the <br>
          page.<br></p>
          <p class="texto-com-identacao">HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such <br>
          as Javascript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. <br>
          Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World <br>
          Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintener of both the HTML and the <br>
          CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit <br>
          presentational HTML since 1997.<br></p>
          <p class="texto-com-identacao">In 1980, physicist <span class = "sublinhado">Tim Berners-Lee,</span> a contractor at CERN, <br>
          proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to <br>
          use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo <br>
          proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified <br>
          HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That <br>
          year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau <br>
          collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not <br>
          formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed <br>
          "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an <br>
          encyclopedia first. <br></p>
          <p class="texto-com-identacao">After the HTML and HTML+ draft expired in early 1994, the <br>
          IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed <br>
          "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a <br>
          standard against which future implementations should be based.<br></p>
